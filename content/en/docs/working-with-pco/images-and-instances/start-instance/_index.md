## Launch Instance
Using the button "Launch Instance" you can create one or more new instances and start them. An guided dialogue helps you to go through all required steps. As soon as you have entered enough information for launching an instance the button "Create Instance" becomes available and you can start your new instance(s). Asterisks (*) mark required information.

Keep in mind that shell access to the new instance is only possible via ssh key authentication. Thus you either need to create a ssh keypair during instance creation or upload your keypair beforehand.
