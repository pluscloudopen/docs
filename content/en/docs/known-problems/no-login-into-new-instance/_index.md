You have just started a new instance but you can not login to it via ssh, although you have set up and deployed an ssh keypair - that you generated with putty or puttygen - into OpenStack. 

Even when you have checked, that the right ssh private key is used, the login does not work. 

The reason for this is, that putty and puttygen use a different format for the generation of ssh keypairs than OpenStack. The ssh key pairs, that are used in OpenStack and Linux should be 
saved in OpenSSH format. If you have a ssh key pair already, you can convert it into OpenSSH format with putty, save it and upload the public key into OpenStack.

In puttygen you just load your ssh private key ("Load private key" in the "File" menu) and then choose "Export OpenSSH key" in the "Conversions" menu.
